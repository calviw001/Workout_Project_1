The first workout project from ICS 32 class.

This program manipulates the words of a text file into something harder to decipher. The program will first read in a text file and invert the messages in the text file 
one by one. Then, the program will write each inverted line into another file, but in reverse order as well. The user will be able to tell the program what text file to 
read from and what file to write in by typing in the command line (ex: python wp1.py originaltext.txt newtext.txt).
